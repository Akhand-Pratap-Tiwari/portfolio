        '${' '*4}a- Fetch product from both platforms and present them at a single place.\n'
        '${' '*4}b- Use AI to randomly sample reviews and make a simple summary out of them for the user.\n'
        '${' '*4}c- Use AI to also determine the positivity of randomly sampled reviews.\n'
        '${' '*4}d- A ranking system that can rank products using positivity of reviews, quantity of positive and negative reviews, price.\n\n'

    'Flexible Taxi App (Nov 22 - Feb 23)',
    '- Description: We made a Taxi app that allows passengers to post a requirement about when and where they '
        'want to go. Then on this requirement drivers can emit bids. Then the passenger can choose the appropriate '
        'bid they want to accept. This increases the reachability of drivers and helps passengers to get a fair look at price.\n'
